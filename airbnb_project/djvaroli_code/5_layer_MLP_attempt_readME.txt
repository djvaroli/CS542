In the event that whoever is checking does read this, I wanted to briefly say that I had attempted to build a MLP based on the code from our PS4 and unfortunately was not successful. For some reason my neural network would converge to the mean of all prices and simply put that for every entry. I believe that the network itself is fine however the feature engineering that I did not was not sufficient to generate good results. Also I feel that I was unable to find good parameters for the neural network despite playing around with different weights initiations, different activation functions and other approaches to resolve my issues that I had read about online
